In the fast paced world of software development, ensuring the quality and reliability of applications is paramount. Regression testing plays a critical role in this process by verifying that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities. However, as software products grow in complexity and size, manual regression testing becomes increasingly laborious and prone to human error. This is where automation steps in as a game changer, offering a systematic approach to running tests efficiently and accurately. By implementing automated regression tests, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs slipping through the cracks, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining a competitive edge in the market.
